# Breast-Cancer-Treatment-Prediction
This repository hosts my work (and cited colleague's work) on using Machine Learning for predicting the outcome of a treatment for Breast Cancer Patients using only their mutation profiles.

As we continue to develope this work, this README file will also be updated with our latest benchmarks and methodology. Please note that this repository includes unpublished work.
